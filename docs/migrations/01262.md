# Purpose

A few new theme variables for inputs were added to cover updated Base input designs.
These have default values assigned but you may need to assign values if your app is using a custom theme.

## `createTheme`

Here are the new variables and one renamed variable:

```diff
- inputFillEnhancer
+ inputEnhancerFill
+ inputEnhancerFillDisabled
+ inputEnhancerTextDisabled
+ inputFillActive
+ inputFillPositive
+ inputBorderError
+ inputBorderPositive
```
